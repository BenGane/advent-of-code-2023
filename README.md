# Advent Of Code - TypeScript Solutions

These are my TypeScript solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. This is not supposed to be a guide or a reference, but rather a place to store my solutions and track my progress.

## Structure examples

- [`challenges/day-8/1.spec.ts`](./challenges/day-8/1.spec.ts) - solution for the eighth day challenge of 2023 year (in a form of a test so I get quick reruns on save)

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/BenGane/advent-of-code-2023`
1. (optional) `nvm i` - or use any other node version manager of choice
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`
