# Advent Of Code - TypeScript Solutions

These are my TypeScript solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. This is not supposed to be a guide or a reference, but rather a place to store my solutions and track my progress.

## Structure examples

- [`2023/1.input.txt`](./2023/1.input.txt) - input for the first day challenge of 2023 year
- [`2023/1.spec.ts`](./2023/1.spec.ts) - solution for the first day challenge of 2023 year (in a form of a test so I get quick reruns on save)
- [`2023/2-1.spec.ts`](./2023/2-1.spec.ts) - solution for the first part of the second day challenge of 2023 year

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/advent-of-code`
1. (optional) `nvm i` - or use any other node version manager of choice
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`
